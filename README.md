# How to change IP geographic location in TestNG with Appium on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=appium-testNG-geoLocation)

While performing app automation testing with appium on LambdaTest Grid, you may face a scenario where you would like to simulate location of a specific country. You can easily do that by using the lambdatest capability "GeoLocation" and refer the 2-letter country code in the automation script. You can refer to sample test repo [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-java-testng).

# Steps:

The following is an example on how to set geoLocation in the capabilities.

```java
import io.appium.java_client.AppiumDriver;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;
import org.openqa.selenium.remote.DesiredCapabilities;
import io.appium.java_client.MobileElement;
import java.net.URL;
public class AndroidApp {
    String userName = System.getenv("LT_USERNAME") == null ?
            "username" : System.getenv("LT_USERNAME"); //Enter your username here
    String accessKey = System.getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY") == null ?
            "accessKey" : System.getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY"); //Enter your accessKey here
    public String gridURL = "@mobile-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub";
    AppiumDriver driver;
    @Test
    @org.testng.annotations.Parameters(value = {"device", "version", "platform"})
    public void AndroidApp1() {
        try {
            DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
                capabilities.setCapability("build","Enter_your_build_name"); //Enter your build name here
                capabilities.setCapability("name","Enter_your_test_name"); //Enter your test name here
                capabilities.setCapability("deviceName", "Galaxy S21 5G");
                capabilities.setCapability("platformVersion","12");
                capabilities.setCapability("platformName", "Android");
                capabilities.setCapability("isRealMobile", true);
                capabilities.setCapability("app", "lt://"); //Enter your app url here
                //ADD GEOLOCATION BASED ON COUNTRY CODE
                capabilities.setCapability("geoLocation", "fr");
            String hub = "https://" + userName + ":" + accessKey + gridURL;
            driver = new AppiumDriver(new URL(hub), capabilities);
            MobileElement color = (MobileElement) driver.findElementById("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/color");
            color.click();
            MobileElement text = (MobileElement) driver.findElementById("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/Text");
            text.click();
            MobileElement toast = (MobileElement) driver.findElementById("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/toast");
            toast.click();
            MobileElement notification = (MobileElement) driver.findElementById("com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/notification");
            notification.click();
            Thread.sleep(2000);
            driver.quit();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            driver.quit();
            }
        }
     }
```
## Run your test

```bash
mvn clean install -DsuiteXmlFile=src/test/java/Android.xml
```
Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
